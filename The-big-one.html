<p style="font-size:30px;">Rhiana and I didnt start out like other couples with dating. we talked and realized we didnt need the dating process because when you learn enough about a person and tell how they are and you yourself know what you want then you can just go fore it and fall in love much easier with the perfect woman like I did.</p>
